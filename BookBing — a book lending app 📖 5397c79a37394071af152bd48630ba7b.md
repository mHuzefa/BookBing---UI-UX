# UX Research

## Challenge/Problem üò∑

There are many social apps that connect people around the world but there is no common place for book lovers to meet and connect each other. If any book lover wants to read the book, and can not afford to buy the book. They compromise on not reading it.

## Solution üôå

This app will provide the place for all the book lovers to connect with each other and also post reviews about the books they read. 

It deals with most important problem where anyone who has book available to be rented, can post on bookbing and it will show on general post section and anyone who needs the book, can contact the user. 

Post will appear in nearby region where the lender can easily contact the renter through built-in messaging app.

## Let's analyze Home screen

### Top Navigation

Top Navigation covers two navs, **primary** and **secondary.** 

Primary navbar includes:

- **GPS icon** ‚Äî  it will help users to find the posts according to their current location. So I kept this in primary navbar.
- **Search Icon** ‚Äî users searching for books is primarily focused of this app so, search functionality need to be everywhere in focus for user.
- **Notification** ‚Äî Users need to be notified when they are home screen, that's where most of their time, user will spend

Secondary Navbar includes:

- **Home button** ‚Äî user should scroll through the app and can find different type of posts
- **Find books** ‚Äî because user come to find the book through this app, this functionality will filter out all other posts and will show the posts that are available to lend.
- **Filter icon** ‚Äî User can filter through different functionalities too.

## Post

Post needs to have name, picture and location where is posted. But I also included the **title heading** to highlight the post. 

User can **like**, **comment** or **share** the post. But most important, users can bookmark the post for later use.

### Bottom Navigation

Bottom Navigation displays 5 main functionalities this app contains. 

- **Home Icon ‚Äî** to come to home screen.
- **Message icon ‚Äî**  to go to message app screen directly from the bottom navigation because after searching for book, user spend time on messaging to connect with the renter or lender.
- **Add Post Icon ‚Äî** This icon is the center of attention of the app. We want user to post the books which he wants to rent or lend.
- **Library Icon ‚Äî** book library of user, which book he wants to read or has read can add here.
- **Profile Icon ‚Äî** User profile and settings
